You look around the living-room, you see two small, boarded up, windows, a
large number of animal nests up on the rafters; apparently this room had more
animals living in it than ponies. Other than this, the room had a small table,
a couch, a coo-coo clock, and various decorative pieces laying about.
Fluttershy is standing by the door, idly looking around.
