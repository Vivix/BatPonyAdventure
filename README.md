BatPonyAdventure
================

If you want to use this as a way to create your own quick adventure, you only need
the ponyadventure.bat file, and create new files for it to print. The ponyadventure.bat
file contains certain variables, near the top, that control aspects of the game, which
would need to be replaced for a new adventure.

A 'just for fun' and 'why not' pony-based adventure game/demo in batch.
Currently only compatible with Windows XP+ Commandline. Running in MS-DOS, or other dos variants, need a replacement for set/p as a minimum.

This was created as a "can I?" thing during bouts of intense boredom and lack of ponies.
