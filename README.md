BatPonyAdventure
================

A 'just for fun' and 'why not' pony-based adventure game/demo in batch.
Currently only compatible with Windows XP+ Commandline. Running in MS-DOS, or other dos variants, need a replacement for set/p as a minimum.

This was created as a "can I?" thing during bouts of intense boredom and lack of ponies.
